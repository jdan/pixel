## pixel

This repo was an experiment in making art for my [LED matrix](https://discord.com/channels/@me/701187787948425286/852601868218794045). It has since been turned into a dedicated chess display.

I run this repo on a raspberry pi with `node screen.js` as a startup script. I have no plans to update it but no need to keep it to myself.

I've since moved onto making art for an e-ink display over at [jdan/hashart](https://github.com/jdan/hashart) ([hash.jordanscales.com](https://hash.jordanscales.com)).
